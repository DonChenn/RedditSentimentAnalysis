# Reddit Sentiment Analysis

This project investigates sentiment analysis by analyzing Reddit posts to classify both political orientation and sentiment polarity. We will train a political classifier using the "Liberals vs Conservatives" dataset and a sentiment classifier using a subset of the dataset of 1 million Reddit comments, while employing unsupervised clustering (BERTopic) to identify topics. We will compare baseline (ex: VADER) and advanced (ex: RoBERTa) methods using classification accuracy, F1-score, and real-time inference latency to evaluate a live application that visualizes sentiment disparity between political groups.
